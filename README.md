# ExamplesFromVideo
Intent is 1 file/module per 1 video, with fairly consistent naming here vs video site.
I have been making tools using Excel, Access, and VBA since 1990s. No CS degree, but
I've produced some decent solutions, often with help from Walkenbach, Mehta, Jelen, 
several others and of course StackOverflow and SuperUser. I also watch a little bit
of Excel and Access how-to video. I don't want to post redundant content, or
non-optimal solutions, but I cannot watch all the related videos either. Putting 
up videos concerning things I don't _think_ have been addressed before. And for each
video I put up, I will push some code here. The scope will vary. There will be some 
deep-dives. Part of the reason I am doing these videos is to jog my memory more 
quickly should I have to make changes. (Some of the projects are 'production code' 
in continuous use for many years, that have been tweaked to the point I almost never
have to look at them.) I've improved a little along the way but mostly you'll see very
procedural code. I have the RubberDuck add-in and I read everything Mathieu Guindon 
writes, but I won't enable the add-in until I've integrated Mathieu's innovations 
'the hard way' enough that is becomes muscle-memory.
